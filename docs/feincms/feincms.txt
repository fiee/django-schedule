=====================================
Integrate DjangoSchedule with FeinCMS
=====================================

FeinCMS is a Django-based CMS by Matthias Kestenholz (feinheit.ch),
see http://github.com/matthiask/feincms/

Models
------

FeinCMS pages consist of content blocks that can come from 
different apps/modules.

``models.py`` is a sample how to use Events and Calendars from
DjangoSchedule as content types in FeinCMS.

Templates
---------

As you can see in ``models.py``, FeinCMS renders content blocks
with separate templates that live normally in ``templates/content``.
